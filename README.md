# Master-DSA Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills by solving problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It serves as a structured collection of solutions implemented in various programming languages, focusing on efficiency and best coding practices.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a well-organized structure for easy navigation and better maintainability:

â”œâ”€â”€ Pattern/
â”œâ”€â”€ Topics.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each directory contains solutions categorized based on problem types, ensuring systematic learning.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Master-DSA.git
  cd Master-DSA
  ```
- Navigate to the relevant folder based on the topic.
- Each problem should have two files:
  - A **question/problem statement** file (`<problem_name>.txt`)
  - A **solution file** (`<problem_name>.cpp/.java/.py`)
- Naming convention:
  - Use all lowercase with `_` to separate words (e.g., `longest_common_subsequence.txt`, `longest_common_subsequence.py`).
- Each solution file includes:
  - Problem statement (as comments or linked to LeetCode)
  - Optimized code implementation
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Clear comments explaining the logic

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
3. Add your solutions and ensure they follow a structured format.
4. Commit and push your changes:
   ```bash

   ```
5. Open a Pull Request for review.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: **C, C++, Java, Python**
- Git for version control
- Markdown for documentation

## Guidelines
This repository is primarily focused on **logic development** and **problem-solving**. However, to maintain consistency, please stick to the main four programming languages: **C, C++, Java, and Python**. Additionally, always mention **time and space complexity** at the end of your code and provide **clear comments explaining the logic**.
